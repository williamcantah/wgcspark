\title{Plot Time Series Grid with the Stata Theme}
\usage{
tspanel_plot(data, vars, freq = "monthly", start_date = "2000-01-01")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing your time series data (without a date column).}

\item{vars}{A character vector of column names representing the time series variables to plot.}

\item{freq}{A character string indicating the frequency of the data. One of \code{"monthly"}, \code{"quarterly"}, or \code{"annual"}.}

\item{start_date}{A character string representing the starting date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. Defaults to "2000-01-01".}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the time series plots.
}
\description{
This function generates colorful time series plots for selected variables in a data frame.
It automatically creates a date variable based on a specified frequency (monthly, quarterly, or annual)
and arranges each time series in its own facet with a free y-axis using ggthemes' Stata theme.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Simulate example data with four time series variables (24 observations each)
  set.seed(123)
  mydata <- data.frame(
    stock_price       = cumsum(rnorm(24, mean = 3, sd = 5)) + 1000,
    restaurant_sales  = rpois(24, lambda = 10),
    commodity_sales   = rpois(24, lambda = 5),
    satisfaction_rate = runif(24, min = 0.7, max = 1.0)
  )

  # Generate the time series plot with monthly frequency
  ts_plot <- tspanel_plot(
    data = mydata,
    vars = c("stock_price", "restaurant_sales", "commodity_sales", "satisfaction_rate"),
    freq = "monthly",
    start_date = "2000-01-01"
  )
  print(ts_plot)
