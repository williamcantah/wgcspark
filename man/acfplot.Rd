\title{Plot Autocorrelation Function (ACF) with Stata Theme and Critical Bounds}
\usage{
acfplot(data, vars, lag.max = 20, title = "Autocorrelation Function")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the time series data.}

\item{vars}{A character vector of variable names to analyze.}

\item{lag.max}{Maximum lag at which to calculate the ACF. Default is 20.}

\item{title}{Title for the plot. Default is "Autocorrelation Function".}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
}
\description{
This function calculates and plots the autocorrelation function (ACF) for one or more numeric time
series variables contained in a data frame. The ACF values are displayed as a bar graph, and the function
overlays 5% critical bounds (calculated as ±1.96/√n). The Stata theme from ggthemes is applied.
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
df <- data.frame(
  var1 = cumsum(rnorm(100)),
  var2 = cumsum(rnorm(100))
)
acf_plot <- acfplot(df, vars = c("var1", "var2"), lag.max = 20,
                           title = "ACF for Example Variables")
print(acf_plot)
