\title{wgcspark: A Comprehensive Toolkit for Time Series Analysis and Visualization}
\description{
The **wgcspark** package provides an integrated set of functions for converting,
plotting, and analyzing time series data. Designed primarily for applied
time series research and exploratory data analysis, the package includes functions
that can:
}
\details{
- Convert data frame columns to \code{ts} objects with an associated Date column
  (see \code{\link{tsconvert}}).

- Generate combined or individual time series plots with customizable frequencies
  and date sequences (see \code{\link{tsplot}}, \code{\link{tsplot_ind}}, and
  \code{\link{tspanel_plot}}).

- Compute and visualize autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF)
  functions as bar graphs with the Stata theme and critical bounds (see
  \code{\link{acfplot}} and \code{\link{pacfplot}}).

- Run multiple unit root tests (ADF, KPSS, Phillips–Perron, and NG–Perron) on time series,
  report key statistics, and export the output to a Word document for further reporting
  and analysis (see \code{\link{urtest}}).

Each function is documented with detailed parameter descriptions, usage examples, and
return values to facilitate ease-of-use and rapid deployment in time series analyses.
