\title{Run Unit Root Tests on Multiple Time Series}
\usage{
urtest(data, varnames)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing at least one time series (of class \code{ts}).}

\item{varnames}{A character vector specifying the column names in \code{data} that are time series.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a combined data frame that contains the results for each variable.
}
\description{
This function runs several unit root tests (ADF, KPSS, Phillips-Perron, and NG-Perron)
on specified time series variables contained in a data frame. It extracts the test statistics,
p-values, and the critical values (1%, 5%, and 10%) into separate columns.
The results are printed to the console and exported to a Word document using \code{officer::read_docx},
\code{officer::body_add_par}, \code{flextable::flextable}, and \code{officer::print}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Simulate three monthly time series (10 years; 120 observations each)
set.seed(123)
ts1 <- ts(rnorm(120, mean = 0, sd = 1), start = c(2000, 1), frequency = 12)
set.seed(456)

# Create a data frame with the simulated time series.
monthly <- data.frame(
